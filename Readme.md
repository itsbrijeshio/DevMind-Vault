# 🧠 DevMind Vault

Welcome to **DevMind Vault** — my second brain, powered by [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).  
This is a structured knowledge system built to capture everything I learn and build as a self-taught full stack developer, product creator, and passionate problem solver.

## 🚀 Why This Vault Exists

Like many developers, I used to forget what I learned. Now, every concept, bug fix, roadmap, project, and idea has a permanent, connected home in this vault — stored as Markdown files, forever in my control.
